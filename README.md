Sound 1 & 2 made with [JXFR](https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/).

Sound 3 - 6 made with [BeepBox](https://beepbox.co/).

## Notes ##

If more time, would've implemented reverse twist where the algorithm would choose 
a number from 1-8 instead with 8 being the reverse (reverses the answer vector).

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
